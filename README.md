Hello!
This is my first-ever portfolio project completed as part of Codecademy's Data Analytics Career Path Coursework. In this project, I have put to test some fundamental data science skillsets I've picked up by this point, including data visualization techniques using seaborn and matplotlib, as well as statistical tests to determine the correlation between different variables.
Hope you enjoy my analyses! Thank you!
